Before changing the code and making your own changes, you need to install the latest version of the python 
(the link to the installer's website will be in a separate document), and you also need to run the file with the 
.bat extension so that the module is automatically installed(or you can install it manually in CMD: discord.py-->
pip install discord.py)
P.S.If you didn't succeed, you can watch video courses on the Internet or write to us by email
